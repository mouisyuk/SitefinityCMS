1.10.1.2. Exceptions. We will not indemnify you to the extent that the alleged infringement or misappropriation results from (a) use of the Product in combination with any other software or item not supplied by us; (b) failure to promptly implement an Update provided by us pursuant to 1.10.1.3 (Our Options); (c) modification of the Product not made or provided by us; or (d) use of the Product in a manner not permitted by this EULA.

1.10.1.3. Our Options. If a final injunction is, or we reasonably believe that it could be, obtained against your use of the Product, or if in our opinion the Product is likely to become the subject of a successful claim of infringement, we may, at our option and expense, (a) replace or modify the Product so that it becomes non-infringing (provided that the functionality is substantially equivalent), (b) obtain for you a license to continue to use the Product, or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) are reasonably practicable, terminate this EULA on thirty (30) days’ notice and, if the Product was licensed to you on a Perpetual License or Term License basis, refund to you the license fee paid to us for the Product less an amount for depreciation determined on a straight-line five year (or actual term if shorter) depreciation basis with a commencement date as of the date of delivery of the Product, or if the Product was licensed to you on a Subscription License basis, refund to you the unused portion of the fees paid in advance to us for the then-current subscription period for the Product. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS SET OUT IN THIS SECTION 1.10.1 STATE OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY INFRINGEMENT OR ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT BY US OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF THE PRODUCT OR ITS USE.

1.10.2. Your Indemnification Obligation.

1.10.2.1. Indemnification for Third Party-Claims. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you will defend us and our Affiliates, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all third party claims, lawsuits, and proceedings that arise or result from (a) your breach of this EULA, (b) your use, distribution and/or licensing of the Redistributables, if applicable, except to the extent it arises from an IP Claim covered under section 1.10.1 above, or (c) your failure or alleged failure to comply with Applicable Laws or any violation of a third party’s rights in connection with your use of the Product (each a “ Third-Party Claim ” and collectively “ Third-Party Claims ”) and you will indemnify for damages finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to any Third-Party Claim.

1.10.3. Control of the Defense or Settlement. For any indemnification obligation covered in section 1.10.1,“ Indemnifying Party ” means us, “ Indemnified Party ” means you, and “ Claim ” means an IP Claim. For any indemnification obligation covered in section 1.10.2, “ Indemnifying Party ” means you, “ Indemnified Party ” means us, and “ Claim ” means a Third-Party Claim. The Indemnified Party must provide the Indemnifying Party with prompt written notice of a Claim; however, the Indemnified Party’s failure to provide or delay in providing such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this section except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by the Indemnified Party’s failure or delay. The Indemnified Party will give the Indemnifying Party full control of the defense and settlement of the Claim as long as such settlement does not include a financial obligation on or admission of liability by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party does not do so, then the Indemnified Party waives the Indemnifying Party’s indemnification obligations under section 1.10.1 or 1.10.2, as applicable. The Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate in the defense of the Claim and may appear, at its own expense, through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party.
